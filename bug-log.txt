ECE 391 MP3 Bug Log

Checkpoint 3.1

GDT not working:
- Symptom: gdt not working after writing code for GDT and IDT, boot loop
- Difficulty: hard, 4-5 hours
- Solution: created a new gdt_desc pointer instead of using the originally defined
gdt_desc that was originally declared somewhere else

IDT writing:
- Symptom: IDT was not working, compiler error
- Difficulty: not hard, 30 mins
- Solution: the second parameter of SET_IDT should not have parentheses, 
because it is just a string

IDT:
- Symptom: IDT was not working, boot loop on exception call
- Difficulty: 2-3 hours
- Solution: set present to 0 for values greater than 20, 1 for < 20 because
that is the correct exception. Set everything to interrupt gate and ignored 
reserve4 value

Paging:
- Symptom: pg disabled
- Difficulty: 2-3 hours
- Solution: cr4 needs to be initialized before enabling paging in cr0

Paging kernel memory:
- Symptom: Incorrect kernel mem location, going into boot loop
- Difficulty: 1-2 hours
- Solution: kernel memory location is at 4MB = 1024 * 1024 * 4, should 
be shifted by 12 bits before putting into PDE

Keyboard:
- Symptom: When testing keyboard, key up also registered, causing doubele press
- Difficulty: 1-2 hours
- Solution: checked whether scancode within bounds, masking key up scancodes

Keyboard (General Bug):
- Symptom: globally defined variable i was not being updated, causing us to think
keyboard is not being pressed > once
- Difficulty: medium, 45 minutes
- Solution: named variable differently becuase i value re-initialized

PIC:
- Symptom: RTC was not wokring properly, not cycling correctly
- Difficulty: hard, 4-5 hours
- Solution: We did not initialize master PIC in the case when slave was being
serviced, added the condition.

RTC:
- Symptom: RTC compiling but test_interrupts not working
- Difficulty: medium, 2-3 hours
- Solution: We messed up the ordering of arguments in outb, 
different from OSDEV

RTC:
- Symptom: RTC compiling but test_interrupts not working
- Difficulty: easy, 45 minute
- Solution: Used the wrong port, 0x0C instead of 0x8C
